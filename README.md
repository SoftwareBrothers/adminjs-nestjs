# NestJS plugin for AdminJS

This is an official [AdminJS](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs) plugin which integrates it to [nestjs](https://nestjs.com) framework.

## AdminJS

AdminJS is an automatic admin interface which can be plugged into your application. You, as a developer, provide database models (like posts, comments, stores, products or whatever else your application uses), and AdminJS generates UI which allows you (or other trusted users) to manage content.

Check out the example application with mongo and postgres models here: https://admin-bro-example-app-staging.herokuapp.com/admin

Or visit [AdminJS](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs) github page.
